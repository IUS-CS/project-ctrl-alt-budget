# Ctrl-Alt-Budget Project Proposal

## Project Vision

This project aims to create a finance tracking application that empowers users to keep track of where their money is going and find different ways to budget. This application can be applied to your average 9-5 employee, all the way to large business owners, giving essentially any users access to different spending insights as well as graphs to give visual aids to user about where and how they spend their money. We intend to create an interactive UI that allows user to create their budget, add expenses, and connect spending accounts to automate expense tracking.
